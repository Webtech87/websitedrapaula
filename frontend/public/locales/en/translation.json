In the occupational therapy literature on play, there are concerns regarding how occupational therapists approach the role of play in their intervention.",
      "equipaments_p2": "Various articles suggest limitations and a lack of emphasis on play-focused interventions by pediatric occupational therapists. These limitations include diminished attitudes toward play, with greater emphasis placed on competencies unrelated to play (e.g., motor, social skills), failure to assess play, and difficulty defining a play-focused intervention plan.",
      "equipaments_p3": "However, assessing play and engaging in play-focused interventions are vital for child development, health, and honoring childhood.",
