In the occupational therapy literature on play, there are concerns regarding how occupational therapists approach the role of play in their intervention.",
      "equipaments_p2": "Various articles suggest limitations and a lack of emphasis on play-focused interventions by pediatric occupational therapists. These limitations include diminished attitudes toward play, with greater emphasis placed on competencies unrelated to play (e.g., motor, social skills), failure to assess play, and difficulty defining a play-focused intervention plan.",
      "equipaments_p3": "However, assessing play and engaging in play-focused interventions are vital for child development, health, and honoring childhood.",

      "description": "Fine motor skills are how we use our arms, hands, and fingers. They refer to the skills needed to manipulate an object, meaning how to use the hand and fingers precisely, according to the demands of the activity. The development of fine motor skills is essential for the child's interaction with the environment and happens when the child engages with objects and uses tools, for example in daily life activities. This book focuses on the development of fine motor skills across different childhood age groups, illustrating their relationship with the child's everyday life. In addition to development, it explores the skills required for fine motor skills to develop smoothly. It also recommends equipment and materials that can help children who have difficulties in this area.",

      "description": "Sensory integration is the neurological process that organizes our sensations and is the foundation for all forms of learning so that we can live in the world and make sense of it. It is the base for academic learning, for the skills needed to perform daily life and social activities, and even for the ability to have empathy for others. What we see, smell, hear, taste, or touch is deciphered at every moment in our living experience, along with our 'hidden senses': vestibular and proprioceptive. When a child has problems processing sensations (sensory integration dysfunction), they struggle to use the information received through the senses to function efficiently in daily activities – problems may arise with motor coordination, sleep regulation, eating, attention, self-care tasks, learning, play, and emotional and social development.",

      "description": "All babies are born with characteristics that make them unique. Gradually, they adapt to their family and the environment in which they are born, and naturally, development happens and autonomy emerges as they engage and move within the family's life cycle. Development is the term used to describe the changes in a child's physical growth and their ability to learn in terms of sensorimotor, socioemotional, cognitive behavior, and communication skills. All these areas are interconnected, each depending on and influencing the others, becoming visible through the baby's behavior and their increasing autonomy.",
